Every payload is\n *      dispatched to every registered callback.\n *   2) Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other callbacks have\n *      been executed.\n *\n * For example, consider this hypothetical flight destination form, which\n * selects a default city when a country is selected:\n *\n *   var flightDispatcher = new Dispatcher();\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which country is selected\n *   var CountryStore = {country: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which city is selected\n *   var CityStore = {city: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of the base flight price of the selected city\n *   var FlightPriceStore = {price: null}\n *\n * When a user changes the selected city, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'city-update',\n *     selectedCity: 'paris'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by `CityStore`:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'city-update') {\n *       CityStore.city = payload.selectedCity;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the user selects a country, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'country-update',\n *     selectedCountry: 'australia'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by both stores:\n *\n *    CountryStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       CountryStore.country = payload.selectedCountry;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the callback to update `CountryStore` is registered, we save a reference\n * to the returned token. Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee\n * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`\n * needs to query its data.\n *\n *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.\n *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);\n *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.\n *\n *       // Select the default city for the new country\n *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:\n *\n *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =\n *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *       switch (payload.actionType) {\n *         case 'country-update':\n *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *\n *         case 'city-update':\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             FlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'\n * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then\n * `FlightPriceStore`.\n */\n\n  function Dispatcher() {\n    this.$Dispatcher_callbacks = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isPending = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isHandled = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isDispatching = false;\n    this.$Dispatcher_pendingPayload = null;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Registers a callback to be invoked with every dispatched payload.

It decorates your values in a type safe manner.\n     *\n     * For example if you return an array from a string based method then the returned value will be decorated with array methods and not the string methods. This allow you as the developer to focus on your API and not worrying about how to properly build and connect your API.\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Installation\n     *\n     * ```\n     * npm install extender\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Or [download the source](https://raw.github.com/doug-martin/extender/master/extender.js) ([minified](https://raw.github.com/doug-martin/extender/master/extender-min.js))\n     *\n     * **Note** `extender` depends on [`declare.js`](http://doug-martin.github.com/declare.js/).\n     *\n     * ### Requirejs\n     *\n     * To use with requirejs place the `extend` source in the root scripts directory\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     *\n     * define([\"extender\"], function(extender){\n     * });\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Usage\n     *\n     * **`extender.define(tester, decorations)`**\n     *\n     * To create your own extender call the `extender.define` function.\n     *\n     * This function accepts an optional tester which is used to determine a value should be decorated with the specified `decorations`\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * function isString(obj) {\n     *     return !isUndefinedOrNull(obj) && (typeof obj === \"string\" || obj instanceof String);\n     * }\n     *\n     *\n     * var myExtender = extender.define(isString, {\n     *\t\tmultiply: function (str, times) {\n     *\t\t\tvar ret = str;\n     *\t\t\tfor (var i = 1; i < times; i++) {\n     *\t\t\t\tret += str;\n     *\t\t\t}\n     *\t\t\treturn ret;\n     *\t\t},\n     *\t\ttoArray: function (str, delim) {\n     *\t\t\tdelim = delim || \"\";\n     *\t\t\treturn str.split(delim);\n     *\t\t}\n     *\t});\n     *\n     * myExtender(\"hello\").multiply(2).value(); //hellohello\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * If you do not specify a tester function and just pass in an object of `functions` then all values passed in will be decorated with methods.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     *\n     * function isUndefined(obj) {\n     *     var undef;\n     *     return obj === undef;\n     * }\n     *\n     * function isUndefinedOrNull(obj) {\n     *\tvar undef;\n     *     return obj === undef || obj === null;\n     * }\n     *\n     * function isArray(obj) {\n     *     return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj) === \"[object Array]\";\n     * }\n     *\n     * function isBoolean(obj) {\n     *     var undef, type = typeof obj;\n     *     return !isUndefinedOrNull(obj) && type === \"boolean\" || type === \"Boolean\";\n     * }\n     *\n     * function isString(obj) {\n     *     return !isUndefinedOrNull(obj) && (typeof obj === \"string\" || obj instanceof String);\n     * }\n     *\n     * var myExtender = extender.define({\n     *\tisUndefined : isUndefined,\n     *\tisUndefinedOrNull : isUndefinedOrNull,\n     *\tisArray : isArray,\n     *\tisBoolean : isBoolean,\n     *\tisString : isString\n     * });\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * To use\n     *\n     * ```\n     * var undef;\n     * myExtender(\"hello\").isUndefined().value(); //false\n     * myExtender(undef).isUndefined().value(); //true\n     * ```\n     *\n     * You can also chain extenders so that they accept multiple types and decorates accordingly.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * myExtender\n     *     .define(isArray, {\n     *\t\tpluck: function (arr, m) {\n     *\t\t\tvar ret = [];\n     *\t\t\tfor (var i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; i++) {\n     *\t\t\t\tret.push(arr[i][m]);\n     *\t\t\t}\n     *\t\t\treturn ret;\n     *\t\t}\n     *\t})\n     *     .define(isBoolean, {\n     *\t\tinvert: function (val) {\n     *\t\t\treturn !val;\n     *\t\t}\n     *\t});\n     *\n     * myExtender([{a: \"a\"},{a: \"b\"},{a: \"c\"}]).pluck(\"a\").value(); //[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n     * myExtender(\"I love javascript!\").toArray(/\\s+/).pluck(\"0\"); //[\"I\", \"l\", \"j\"]\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Notice that we reuse the same extender as defined above.\n     *\n     * **Return Values**\n     *\n     * When creating an extender if you return a value from one of the decoration functions then that value will also be decorated. If you do not return any values then the extender will be returned.\n     *\n     * **Default decoration methods**\n     *\n     * By default every value passed into an extender is decorated with the following methods.\n     *\n     * * `value` : The value this extender represents.\n     * * `eq(otherValue)` : Tests strict equality of the currently represented value to the `otherValue`\n     * * `neq(oterValue)` : Tests strict inequality of the currently represented value.\n     * * `print` : logs the current value to the console.\n     *\n     * **Extender initialization**\n     *\n     * When creating an extender you can also specify a constructor which will be invoked with the current value.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * myExtender.define(isString, {\n     *\tconstructor : function(val){\n     *     //set our value to the string trimmed\n     *\t\tthis._value = val.trimRight().trimLeft();\n     *\t}\n     * });\n     * ```\n     *\n     * **`noWrap`**\n     *\n     * `extender` also allows you to specify methods that should not have the value wrapped providing a cleaner exit function other than `value()`.\n     *\n     * For example suppose you have an API that allows you to build a validator, rather than forcing the user to invoke the `value` method you could add a method called `validator` which makes more syntactic sense.\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * var myValidator = extender.define({\n     *     //chainable validation methods\n     *     //...\n     *     //end chainable validation methods\n     *\n     *     noWrap : {\n     *         validator : function(){\n     *             //return your validator\n     *         }\n     *     }\n     * });\n     *\n     * myValidator().isNotNull().isEmailAddress().validator(); //now you dont need to call .value()\n     *\n     *\n     * ```\n     * **`extender.extend(extendr)`**\n     *\n     * You may also compose extenders through the use of `extender.extend(extender)`, which will return an entirely new extender that is the composition of extenders.\n     *\n     * Suppose you have the following two extenders.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * var myExtender = extender\n     *        .define({\n     *            isFunction: is.function,\n     *            isNumber: is.number,\n     *            isString: is.string,\n     *            isDate: is.date,\n     *            isArray: is.array,\n     *            isBoolean: is.boolean,\n     *            isUndefined: is.undefined,\n     *            isDefined: is.defined,\n     *            isUndefinedOrNull: is.undefinedOrNull,\n     *            isNull: is.null,\n     *            isArguments: is.arguments,\n     *            isInstanceOf: is.instanceOf,\n     *            isRegExp: is.regExp\n     *        });\n     * var myExtender2 = extender.define(is.array, {\n     *     pluck: function (arr, m) {\n     *         var ret = [];\n     *         for (var i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; i++) {\n     *             ret.push(arr[i][m]);\n     *         }\n     *         return ret;\n     *     },\n     *\n     *     noWrap: {\n     *         pluckPlain: function (arr, m) {\n     *             var ret = [];\n     *             for (var i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; i++) {\n     *                 ret.push(arr[i][m]);\n     *             }\n     *             return ret;\n     *         }\n     *     }\n     * });\n     *\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * And you do not want to alter either of them but instead what to create a third that is the union of the two.\n     *\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * var composed = extender.extend(myExtender).extend(myExtender2);\n     * ```\n     * So now you can use the new extender with the joined functionality if `myExtender` and `myExtender2`.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * var extended = composed([\n     *      {a: \"a\"},\n     *      {a: \"b\"},\n     *      {a: \"c\"}\n     * ]);\n     * extended.isArray().value(); //true\n     * extended.pluck(\"a\").value(); // [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]);\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * **Note** `myExtender` and `myExtender2` will **NOT** be altered.\n     *\n     * **`extender.expose(methods)`**\n     *\n     * The `expose` method allows you to add methods to your extender that are not wrapped or automatically chained by exposing them on the extender directly.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * var isMethods = {\n     *      isFunction: is.function,\n     *      isNumber: is.number,\n     *      isString: is.string,\n     *      isDate: is.date,\n     *      isArray: is.array,\n     *      isBoolean: is.boolean,\n     *      isUndefined: is.undefined,\n     *      isDefined: is.defined,\n     *      isUndefinedOrNull: is.undefinedOrNull,\n     *      isNull: is.null,\n     *      isArguments: is.arguments,\n     *      isInstanceOf: is.instanceOf,\n     *      isRegExp: is.regExp\n     * };\n     *\n     * var myExtender = extender.define(isMethods).expose(isMethods);\n     *\n     * myExtender.isArray([]); //true\n     * myExtender([]).isArray([]).value(); //true\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * **Using `instanceof`**\n     *\n     * When using extenders you can test if a value is an `instanceof` of an extender by using the instanceof operator.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * var str = myExtender(\"hello\");\n     *\n     * str instanceof myExtender; //true\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ## Examples\n     *\n     * To see more examples click [here](https://github.com/doug-martin/extender/tree/master/examples)\n     */\n    function defineExtender(declare) {\n\n\n        var slice = Array.prototype.slice, undef;\n\n        function indexOf(arr, item) {\n            if (arr && arr.length) {\n                for (var i = 0, l = arr.length;

If your subclassed however you cannot return a new instance of the parent class as it will not be the right sub class. `declare` provides a way around this by setting the `_static` property on each isntance of the class.\n     *\n     * Lets add a reproduce method `Mammal`\n     *\n     * ```\n     * reproduce : function(options){\n     *     return new this._static(options);\n     * }\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Now in each subclass you can call reproduce and get the proper type.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * var myDog = new Dog();\n     * var myDogsChild = myDog.reproduce();\n     *\n     * myDogsChild instanceof Dog; //true\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ###Using the `as`\n     *\n     * `declare` also provides an `as` method which allows you to add your class to an object or if your using node.js you can pass in `module` and the class will be exported as the module.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * var animals = {};\n     *\n     * Mammal.as(animals, \"Dog\");\n     * Wolf.as(animals, \"Wolf\");\n     * Dog.as(animals, \"Dog\");\n     * Breed.as(animals, \"Breed\");\n     *\n     * var myDog = new animals.Dog();\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Or in node\n     *\n     * ```\n     * Mammal.as(exports, \"Dog\");\n     * Wolf.as(exports, \"Wolf\");\n     * Dog.as(exports, \"Dog\");\n     * Breed.as(exports, \"Breed\");\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * To export a class as the `module` in node\n     *\n     * ```\n     * Mammal.as(module);\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     */\n    function createDeclared() {\n        var arraySlice = Array.prototype.slice, classCounter = 0, Base, forceNew = new Function();\n\n        var SUPER_REGEXP = /(super)/g;\n\n        function argsToArray(args, slice) {\n            slice = slice || 0;\n            return arraySlice.call(args, slice);\n        }\n\n        function isArray(obj) {\n            return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj) === \"[object Array]\";\n        }\n\n        function isObject(obj) {\n            var undef;\n            return obj !== null && obj !== undef && typeof obj === \"object\";\n        }\n\n        function isHash(obj) {\n            var ret = isObject(obj);\n            return ret && obj.constructor === Object;\n        }\n\n        var isArguments = function _isArguments(object) {\n            return Object.prototype.toString.call(object) === '[object Arguments]';\n        };\n\n        if (!isArguments(arguments)) {\n            isArguments = function _isArguments(obj) {\n                return !!(obj && obj.hasOwnProperty(\"callee\"));\n            };\n        }\n\n        function indexOf(arr, item) {\n            if (arr && arr.length) {\n                for (var i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; i++) {\n                    if (arr[i] === item) {\n                        return i;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            return -1;\n        }\n\n        function merge(target, source, exclude) {\n            var name, s;\n            for (name in source) {\n                if (source.hasOwnProperty(name) && indexOf(exclude, name) === -1) {\n                    s = source[name];\n                    if (!(name in target) || (target[name] !== s)) {\n                        target[name] = s;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            return target;\n        }\n\n        function callSuper(args, a) {\n            var meta = this.__meta,\n                supers = meta.supers,\n                l = supers.length, superMeta = meta.superMeta, pos = superMeta.pos;\n            if (l > pos) {\n                args = !args ?

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.
